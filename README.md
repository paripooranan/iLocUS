# iLocUS
Indoor Location Utility Service
A project that achieves indoor positioning using WiFi signals.

# Description
4 WiFi routers are setup at each corner of the grid. The given area (5.4mX5.4m) is divided into 9 cells. Each cell has a dimension of (1.8m X 1.8m). Using TI CC3200 module, the strength of signals are measured at each cell and stored in a database. Using algorithms such as K Nearest neighbours, Support Vector Machine and Artificial Neural Networks the data is classified. For better accuracy, only the WiFi channels 1,6 and 11 are utilized to receive signal strength.
